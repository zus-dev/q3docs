<DL>
<DT>Q3
<DD>The Quake 3 engine as created by Id Software, Inc.  This is the part of the program contained within the platform-specific binaries that (so far) are distributed without source text.  Also known as "the EXE" in Windows.
<DT>Q3A
<DD>"Quake III: Arena", the first game created by Id Software designed to run on the Quake 3 engine.  I make the distinction where "Q3" refers to the engine itself, and "Q3A" refers to the game(play).  Mostly synonymous with "baseq3".
<DT>Q3TA
<DD>"Quake III: Team Arena", the second game created by Id Software designed to run on the Quake 3 engine.  The source code to Q3TA is also packaged in baseq3, but (de)activated with compiler conditionals.  Artwork (models, skins, maps, textures) are packaged separately (as a product) and for the most part is considered an entirely different product from Q3A.
<DT>baseq3
<DD>Refers primarily to the distributed source code for modifications on Q3, the source code corresponding to Q3A.  Also used to refer to Q3A as a special case in the context of mods (the mod from which most others are derived, or "the original mod").
